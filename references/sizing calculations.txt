sizes:

NFS server will be 4-way replicated for all configurations.
The nfsSize will be minimum 10 GB or 10% of the available space on each machine – whichever is smaller and it will be capped to a maximum of 100 GB.

25*4 = per node = 100GB

NFS_SIZE = min(10GB, (10% of raw sizes of all nvmes per host, max of 100GB))

Since we are doing 4-way replication, the NFS_SIZE should be the minimum 
size of all hosts. min(host1, host2, ...)


Placement of NFS servers:
Formula: Start with 1 and place another by adding the expansion number.
Expansion 1: 1,2,3,4
Expansion 2: 1,3,5,7
Expansion 3: 1,4,7,10
Expansion 4: 1,5,9,13
Expansion 5: 1,6,11,16
Expansion 6: 1,7,13,19
Expansion 7: 1,8,15,23
Expansion 8: 1,9,17,25

DB2LOCAL
The size of the DB2LOCAL will be 40% of the available space on each machine if replicated=true.

If replicated=false, the size of DB2LOCAL will be (numNVMe * sizeNVMe – nfsSize) on each host.

This size can be different on each machine if there is no NFS server on the machine. 

The nfsSize will be zero if the machine does not have a NFS server.

For example: If a machine has 4 NVMe of 25 GB size each – the available space will be:
When replicated feature is ON – (4x25-10)*0.4/2=18 GB [18,18,18,18]

Formula: (numNVMe * sizeNVMe – nfsSize) * 0.4 / 2


NODE

If replicated=false, there is no NODE size calculation. 

we will mount everything under /db2db mount point (node + DB2LOCAL). 

If replicated=true, the size of each database partition will be same 
within the same machine but it could increase on machine where there is no NFS server. 
When replicated factor is one (replicated=false), the size of NODE does not 
change but the replicated size is given to the DB2LOCAL so that we have 
more space for the use by data load, local backup and restore.

On machines when it is selected to not have replication 
(example: development environment), we could use that space to stage local 
backup from the machines having role defined as optimized (aka production).

Available space on each node when replicated: 4x25 – (10 + 18) = 72 / (partitions/numNodes) = 6 GB [6 x 24elements] (per partion)
Formula: ((numNVMe * sizeNVMe – (nfsSize + db2localSize))) / ((partitions/numNodes) * 2)
